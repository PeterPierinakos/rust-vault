        <h2>QNA</h2>
	<h3>What language was this website written in?</h3>
	<p>The backend of this website was written completely in Rust, so expect blazing fast speeds if you self host. Front-end is written in vanilla JavaScript because there is no point in using React or WASM for a static HTML front-end.</p>
	<h3>Q. What metadata is collected?</h3>
	<p>Absolutely none. Only username and password is stored on the database for authentication.</p>
	<h3>Q. License?</h3>
	<p>Licensed under the open source GPL v3.0 license. This project is completely open source and distributable as long as you keep the license.</p>
        <h3>Q. How many accounts and plaintext files can I store?</h3>
	<p>Unlimited.</p>
	<h3>Q. What's the catch?</h3>
	<p>None, lol.</p>
